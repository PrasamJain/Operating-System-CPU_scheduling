# Operating-System-CPU_scheduling


The Operating system schedules the processes on the CPU to have the maximum utilization of it and this procedure is called CPU scheduling.
There is a body of software, in fact, that is responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), 
allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that. That body of software is called the operating system (OS).
